# qscanner 🔍

`qscanner` is a high-performance CLI tool for performing deep qualitative analysis on U.S. stocks. It bypasses expensive financial data providers by pulling directly from the SEC's EDGAR database and uses the latest Gemini AI models to evaluate business quality.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Data Sourcing**: Resolves Tickers to SEC CIKs and fetches filings directly from SEC EDGAR.
- **Smart Section Extraction**: Isolates key qualitative sections: Item 1 (Business), Item 1A (Risk Factors), and Item 7 (MD&A).
- **Adversarial Multi-Year Analysis**: Tracks business consistency, detects structural decay, and flags management bias across multiple years.
- **Forensic Quality Assessment**: Evaluates Moat Durability, Strategic Discipline, Risk Escalation, and Capital Allocation Quality.
- **Throttled SEC Access**: Built-in rate limiting (10 requests/sec) to comply with SEC guidelines.

## ⚖️ Scoring Framework (Forensic)

The multi-year analysis uses a strict burden of proof to classify businesses:

- **Pristine**: Clear durable moat, disciplined capital allocation, stable strategy, low risk creep.
- **High**: Durable business with manageable risks and consistent execution.
- **Moderate**: Mixed signals, unclear durability, or capital discipline concerns.
- **Speculative**: Weak moat evidence, strategy drift, elevated risk.
- **Deteriorating**: Structural decay, capital destruction, increasing operational strain.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onglichang/qscanner.git
   cd qscanner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The tool requires two environment variables:

```bash

export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# The SEC requires a User-Agent header for identification
export SEC_USER_AGENT="Your Name yourname@email.com"
```
